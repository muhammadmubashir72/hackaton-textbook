# Hardware Integration Display Skill

## Skill Type
`hardware-section`

## Purpose
Develops hardware and lab setups sections for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course, creating visual representations of equipment and laboratory requirements.

## Capabilities
- Creates hardware and lab setups sections
- Designs visual representations of equipment
- Organizes technical specifications
- Implements interactive elements for hardware details
- Creates lab setup diagrams or illustrations
- Ensures technical accuracy in representations

## Required Inputs
- List of required hardware components
- Technical specifications for each component
- Lab setup requirements
- Visual assets for hardware (if available)
- Safety guidelines
- Installation instructions

## Expected Output
- React component for hardware display
- Associated styling files
- Interactive elements for hardware details
- Lab setup diagrams or illustrations
- Technical specification displays
- Responsive layout design

## Implementation Steps
1. Present hardware requirements in an organized, easy-to-scan format
2. Include images or illustrations of required equipment
3. Provide technical specifications clearly
4. Add links to purchase or learn more about components
5. Include safety guidelines and best practices
6. Organize content by category (sensors, actuators, controllers, etc.)
7. Implement interactive elements to show more details
8. Ensure technical accuracy in all representations
