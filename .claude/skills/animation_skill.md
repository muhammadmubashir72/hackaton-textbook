# Animation Implementation Skill

## Skill Type
`animation`

## Purpose
Implements smooth animations and hover effects using Framer Motion for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course interface, including scroll-based animations.

## Capabilities
- Integrates Framer Motion library into React components
- Creates scroll-triggered animations
- Implements hover effects for interactive elements
- Designs entrance animations for sections
- Optimizes animations for performance
- Creates custom animation sequences

## Required Inputs
- Components that need animation
- Animation preferences (easing, duration, etc.)
- Trigger events (scroll, hover, etc.)
- Performance constraints
- Accessibility requirements for motion

## Expected Output
- React components with integrated animations
- Animation definition files
- Performance-optimized animation code
- Accessibility-compliant animation controls
- Documentation for animation usage

## Implementation Steps
1. Identify elements that need animation
2. Create smooth entrance animations for sections
3. Add subtle hover effects to interactive elements
4. Implement scroll-triggered animations
5. Optimize animations to maintain 60fps performance
6. Provide controls for users to reduce motion if needed
7. Ensure animations enhance rather than distract from content
8. Test animations across different devices and browsers

## Best Practices
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations and interactions
- Implement scroll-triggered animations for content reveals
- Add subtle hover effects to interactive elements
- Optimize animations to maintain 60fps performance
- Provide controls for users to reduce motion if needed
- Ensure animations enhance rather than distract from content
- Test animations across different devices and browsers
- Use appropriate easing functions for natural motion
- Implement staggered animations for related elements
- Add loading states for animated content
