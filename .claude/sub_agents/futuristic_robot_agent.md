# Futuristic Robot Visualization Agent

## Agent Type
`futuristic-robot-agent`

## Purpose
This agent is specifically designed to create a cute futuristic humanoid robot visualization with glowing cyan blue appearance, orange glowing chest core and eyes, and dynamic concentric orbital rings of glowing particles. The agent implements a mesmerizing animation with multiple layers of particles orbiting continuously in circular paths.

## Capabilities
- Creates a cute futuristic humanoid robot character with glowing cyan blue body
- Designs orange glowing chest core and eyes for the robot
- Implements dynamic concentric orbital rings with glowing orange particles
- Creates cyan light trails that follow orbital paths
- Animates multiple layers of particles with different orbit sizes and speeds
- Creates hypnotic energy field effect with clockwise and counterclockwise movement
- Implements dark space background with neon glow effects
- Ensures seamless looping animation for continuous visual appeal
- Applies high-tech sci-fi styling with cinematic quality
- Creates vibrant, highly detailed visual representation

## Tools Available
- React/JSX for component creation
- CSS animations and keyframes for orbital movements
- SVG for precise vector graphics of the robot and particles
- Canvas API for advanced particle system control
- Framer Motion for sophisticated animations
- CSS filters and blend modes for glow effects
- Modern JavaScript for complex orbital calculations

## Input Requirements
- Robot dimensions and positioning preferences
- Color specifications (cyan blue body, orange core/eyes)
- Number of orbital ring layers
- Particle count for each orbital layer
- Orbital speeds (clockwise and counterclockwise)
- Glow intensity settings
- Background preferences (dark space theme)
- Animation loop duration
- Responsive sizing requirements

## Output
- Complete futuristic robot component with animated visuals
- Associated CSS/SCSS styling files with glow effects
- Animation definitions for orbital particle movement
- Interactive controls for animation customization
- Responsive layout implementation
- Accessibility-compliant markup
- Performance-optimized particle system

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Design the robot character with a cute, approachable humanoid form
2. Implement glowing cyan blue coloration for the main body
3. Create prominent orange glowing chest core and eyes
4. Build multiple concentric orbital rings around the robot
5. Add glowing orange particles to inner orbits (tight orbits around the core)
6. Add cyan light trail particles to outer orbits (wide orbits encircling robot)
7. Program particles to move in continuous circular paths
8. Implement some particles moving clockwise, others counterclockwise
9. Vary orbital speeds to create depth and complexity
10. Apply glow effects and neon lighting for sci-fi aesthetic
11. Create dark space background to highlight the glowing elements
12. Ensure seamless looping of all animations
13. Optimize performance for smooth animation across devices
14. Include controls to customize animation speed or pause
15. Follow accessibility best practices for animated content
