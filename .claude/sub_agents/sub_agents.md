# Sub-Agents Documentation

## Overview
Sub-agents are specialized autonomous agents that can handle complex, multi-step tasks independently. Each sub-agent has specific capabilities and tools available to it, allowing for efficient task execution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.

## Available Sub-Agents

### 1. Frontend Implementation Agent
- **Type**: frontend-implementation
- **Capabilities**: Creates React components, implements CSS styling, integrates animations
- **Tools**: All available tools
- **Use Cases**: Building the hero section, course modules display, hardware section, and other frontend components

### 2. Animation Specialist Agent
- **Type**: animation-specialist
- **Capabilities**: Implements Framer Motion animations, scroll-based animations, hover effects
- **Tools**: All tools with focus on animation libraries
- **Use Cases**: Creating the animated robotics illustration, scroll-triggered animations, and interactive elements

### 3. Design System Agent
- **Type**: design-system
- **Capabilities**: Implements futuristic typography, dark/light color palettes, responsive layouts
- **Tools**: Design and CSS tools
- **Use Cases**: Establishing the visual identity and design system for the course

### 4. Course Content Agent
- **Type**: course-content
- **Capabilities**: Organizes course modules, learning outcomes, assessments, timeline details
- **Tools**: Content management and organization tools
- **Use Cases**: Creating course modules overview, hardware and lab setups, capstone project highlights

### 5. Responsive Design Agent
- **Type**: responsive-design
- **Capabilities**: Ensures cross-device compatibility, mobile optimization
- **Tools**: Responsive design tools and testing frameworks
- **Use Cases**: Making sure all components work well on different screen sizes

### 6. Quality Assurance Agent
- **Type**: quality-assurance
- **Capabilities**: Tests components, validates accessibility, checks performance
- **Tools**: Testing and validation tools
- **Use Cases**: Ensuring all components meet quality standards before deployment

## Sub-Agent Invocation Process
1. Identify the specific task or component that needs implementation
2. Select the most appropriate sub-agent based on the required capabilities
3. Provide clear instructions and requirements to the sub-agent
4. Monitor the sub-agent's progress and provide additional guidance if needed
5. Review the completed work for quality and alignment with requirements

## Best Practices for Sub-Agent Usage
- Use the most specialized sub-agent for each specific task
- Provide detailed requirements and context
- Allow sub-agents to work independently while monitoring progress
- Combine multiple sub-agents for complex implementations
- Validate the output from each sub-agent before proceeding
