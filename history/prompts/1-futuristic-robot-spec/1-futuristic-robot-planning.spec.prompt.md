## Prompt

bh bnao ab iski 1-futuristic-robot-spec

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the futuristic robot visualization system based on the existing specification. The plan includes:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): Technical context, constitution alignment check, and phase-by-phase implementation strategy with risk assessment.

2. Research Document (research.md): Analysis of animation performance optimization, color accessibility, motion sensitivity support, technology stack integration, and visual design implementation.

3. Data Model (data-model.md): Complete entity definitions including RobotConfiguration, RobotAppearance, ParticleSystem, and their relationships with validation rules.

4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Complete implementation instructions with component code, CSS styling, configuration options, and testing guidelines.

The implementation plan details how to create the futuristic robot visualization with a cute humanoid robot featuring glowing cyan blue body, orange glowing chest core and eyes, surrounded by dynamic concentric orbital rings of particles moving in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions, all with proper accessibility features and responsive design.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive planning for futuristic robot visualization system
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 4 files created (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation phase can now proceed using these artifacts
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase complete with all necessary artifacts for development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): begin implementation based on the plan
